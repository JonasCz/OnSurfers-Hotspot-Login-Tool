###Free access to OnSurfers WiFi hotspots operated by "Surf The Web SL." used at some Spanish hotels. 

To use, connect to the WiFi network, open the app, click the "Connect" button, and enjoy free unlimited access :-) YMMV.

There will be a prebuilt APK in the releases section.

In some (most ?) cases, you only get 10 minutes per hour. This app is basically a script which hits to the "download our app" page and gets a free trial login, normally intended for letting users download the hotel's app for free. Of course we don't download the app, we just get the trial login.

Note that this is for educational purposes only, and is not intended to be used for malicious and / or exploitative purposes. I'm not responsible for anything that may happen because of using this app.
